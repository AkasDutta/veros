A short introduction to PyOM
============================

This model is an adaptation of `pyOM2 <https://wiki.zmaw.de/ifm/TO/pyOM2>`_,
developed by Carsten Eden at Hamburg
University, Germany. In contrast to the original pyOM2, this implementation
does not rely on a Fortran backend for computations - everything runs in
pure Python, down to the last parameterization. This allows scientists to jump
right into action and adapt the model as they please, without having to deal with
ancient code, and to run and process the model dynamically, using our favorite
programming language.
